# Prosper_Loan
This is a report that presents a data analysis for Prosper Loan. Prosper loan dataset contains information about over 113,000 loan listings and 84 variables pointing to a number of factors relating to the loans offered. My task is to manipulate the dataset with the aim of proffering actionable insights and analysis.

I find some columns in this dataset to be very interesting. They include; Term, Loan Status, Estimated Return, Borrower State, Estimated Loss, Borrower State, Occupation, Employment Status, Is Borrower Home owner, Currently In Group, Debt To Income Ratio, Income Range, Income Verifiable, Stated Monthly Income, Loan Original Amount. For this project I will be exploring the different variables and show how they relate to each other. I will also be plotting some visualization using univariate and bivariate plots to explore many relationships in the dataset. Some findings and key insights would also be derived for a presentation.

# Summary
During my exploration, I discovered that there was a strong correlation between the income of the borrower and the loan amount obtained. There is also a correlation between employment status and the loan obtained. The customers in the +$100,000 category do not seem to have pressing needs to obtain loans.
Outside of the main features of interest it is worthy to note and conclude that;
a.	the fact that a borrower is a homeowner improved their chances of getting a higher loan amount. 
b.	most of the customers are credit worthy.
c.  the Employed category has the highest returns, Full time in second and Self-employed in third place. However, the $25,000-$49,999 income range has the highest returns, with $50,000-$74,999 and +$100,000 in second and third places respectively.
d.	there is a strong correlation between the employment status of customers and loans obtained.
e.	there is an increased likelihood of obtaining loans when income source is verifiable.
f.	lots of customers opt for the 36 month term loan duration.
g.	Prosper Loans are more comfortable issuing loans to the Employed category. 
h.	the highest number of customers having loans are domiciled in California. Texas and New York come in second and third places respectively.
i.	Professionals, Computer Programmers, Executives and Teachers all in that particular order took more loans than customers from other occupations.
j.	extremely few customers have running loans going past their due dates.
k.	I observed that the $75,000-$99,000 range has a high delinquency figure despite the high income range. The $50,000-$74,999 income range has the lowest rate of delinquency.
l.	retired and unemployed customers rarely took out loans.
m.	it is understandable that the Employed category also has the highest uncomfortable debt to income ratio among the rest. There are close to 70,000 customers in this category. Such high numbers will impact the debt to income ratio.
n.  debt collection policies of Prosper Loan appear to be adequate as incidences of bad/cancelled loans are not a problem here.
